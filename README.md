# About this repository

Hello! This project is about the Stack Overfkow survey 2023.
If you want to start visualizing the Notebooks, just go to the 'src' folder, and there is all the code of this project. 

If you want to run it, download and unpack the 'data.zip' file. You wouldn't want Git to track version control for your data folder, right??

And, if you want to understand the folder structure, just go to: 
'*./references/folder_structure.md*'

There are some interesting visualizations. Enjoy it as me n.n
